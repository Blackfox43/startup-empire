How to Play (Advanced Features)
Live Mode: In the Sidebar, toggle "Live Mode". This forces the app to auto-refresh every 1 second. This simulates a real-time game loop so you can watch your money grow without clicking.
Prestige: Once you earn $1M (lifetime), check the "Angel Investors" section in the sidebar. You can sell your company to reset your progress but gain a permanent % multiplier on everything. This is how you reach Billions.
Saving: Because Streamlit runs on the cloud, if you close the tab, you lose progress.
To Save: Open the "Save / Load" expander in the sidebar. Copy the long code string. Save it in a text file on your computer.
To Load: Paste that code string back into the box next time you play.
